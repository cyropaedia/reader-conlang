Heaven and Earth
In heaven, there is the sun. In heaven, there is the moon. In heaven, there are stars. There is one sun in heaven. There is one moon. There are many stars, not one star. There are not many suns, but one sun. There are not many moons, but one moon. The sun is above the moon. The stars are above the sun. The sun is below the stars. The moon is below the sun. The stars are below heaven.

Below heaven is the earth. There are not many earths, but one earth. The one earth is below the moon, below the sun, below the stars. In the earth, there are hills and valleys. In the earth, there are rivers and seas. There are no seas in heaven, no rivers in heaven. In heaven, there are stars and sun and moon. The rivers and seas, the hills and valleys, they are on the earth and below the heaven.

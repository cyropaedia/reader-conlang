# Khānē
The Khānē live in the low mountains and hill. They are a largely agrarian society in their early iron age. They raise goats and sheep and grow potatoes, turnips, and carrots as their primary crops. They also cultivate olives in the higher hills and grapes on smoother slopes and in valleys. Their villages are governed by meeting run by a head.

# Religion
The Khānē seem to practice a kind of henotheism. They offer sacrifices

# The Scribe
Writing is largely unknown among the Khānē. This document was produced by a scribe and linguist of the Khānē, who was influenced by outside cultures. The language presented within is a smoothed-over "literary" form of the Khānē language, which occasionally levels irregularity and draws vocabulary from different dialects. 

The Scribe is motivated by a desire to preserve Khānē oral tradition. However, his personal beliefs sometimes bleed into the text, and he presents the various divinities worshipped by the Khānē as aspects of a single divine.
